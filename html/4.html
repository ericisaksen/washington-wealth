        <h3>Family Summit</h3>
        <p>Sharing your financial plan with your family is incredibly important. It’s vital to communicate not only your desires for the distribution of your wealth, but the values that fueled your financial plan. That’s why we created our Family Summit. When you’re ready to communicate your advanced planning initiatives and motives to those you care about most, we facilitate an in-depth meeting to help you share your plan with your family. We take pride in helping our clients thrive for generations, and our mission is to make sure everyone is on the same page and invested in a common goal.</p>
